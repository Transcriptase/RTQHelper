This project is a Python script to automate some of my common laboratory tasks.

To begin, I want to have an automated workflow for RT-qPCRs.

A warning to anyone else who wants to use the code: for now, it contains some hard-coded assumptions about
various protocols and reagents. I've tried to make modular, so you can probably at least reuse pieces, but be careful
that you're not importing my idiosyncratic protocols into your code.
